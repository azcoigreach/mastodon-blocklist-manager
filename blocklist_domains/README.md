## Instance blocklist rules

Domains will be blocked serverwide if they meet any of the criteria below:

* Aggressive bots that interact without enduser consent
* Twitter relays
* Spammers, advertising, or other malicious activity.
* NSFW content without a CW
* Open racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, hate speech, threats, bigotry, etc. (including but not limited to: white supremacy, nazism, fascism, etc.) - go fuck off to your own server.
* Any other content that is illegal in the United States of America.
* Any other content the Administrators deem to be harmful to the community.  Because we have 1st Amendment rights, we can block whatever we want.
